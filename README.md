### What is Requirement Analysis?

- Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed 

# Reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC

- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.

- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.

- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.

- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.

  - Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.


### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis


# 1. Requirement Gathering 

This involves collecting information from stakeholders through methods like interviews, surveys, and observation to understand their needs and expectations for the system.


# 2. Requirement Elicitation 

It focuses on drawing out requirements using interactive techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping to clarify what stakeholders truly need.


# 3. Requirement Documentation 

This step involves recording the gathered requirements in structured formats such as specification documents, user stories, and use cases for clear communication.


# 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling 

Here, the requirements are analyzed for feasibility, prioritized, and represented through models like data flow diagrams to understand their impact and structure.


# 5. Requirement Validation 

In this final step, the documented requirements are reviewed and approved by stakeholders, with clear acceptance criteria and traceability to ensure they are complete and correct.


###  Types of Requirements

## Functional Requirements: What the system should do  the core features and behaviors.

Examples:

- Search Properties: Users can search properties by location, price, and availability.
- User Registration: New users can sign up with personal details and login credentials.
- Property Listings: Display available properties with details and images.
- Booking System: Users can book, view, cancel, or modify bookings.
- User Authentication: Secure login and access control for user roles.


## Non-functional Requirements: How the system should perform quality attributes like speed, security, and usability.

Examples:

- Performance: Load pages within 2 seconds; support 1000 concurrent users.
- Security: Encrypt data, secure logins, and prevent common attacks.
- Scalability: System should handle increased load via horizontal scaling.
- Usability: Simple, intuitive, and mobile-friendly user interface.
- Reliability: Ensure 99.9% uptime and fast recovery from failures.


### Use Case Diagrams


### What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use Case Diagrams illustrate show how different types of users interact with a system to accomplish goals 


### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Visual clarity: Helps stakeholders quickly grasp the system's scope and functionality.
- Requirement gathering: Assists in identifying what the system should do from the user's perspective.
- Communication: Bridges the understanding between non-technical stakeholders and developers.
- System validation: Ensures every feature aligns with user needs.

### Acceptance Criteria


## What is Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance Criteria are a set of predefined conditions that a product or feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders (e.g., clients, product owners, or end-users). 


## Example: 

- Users must be able to select available booking dates from a calendar.
- Users should see a summary of charges before confirming the booking.
- Payment must be securely processed through a payment gateway.
- Booking confirmation should be displayed immediately after successful payment.
- A confirmation email must be sent within 2 minutes of booking.
